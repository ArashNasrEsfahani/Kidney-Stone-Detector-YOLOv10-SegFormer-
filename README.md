### üìñ Overview

Kidney stone detection is a critical diagnostic task that can be challenging due to the variability in stone size, shape, and visibility. This project tackles this challenge by developing a robust, two-stage deep learning pipeline that synergizes the strengths of object detection and semantic segmentation. The system first uses a high-recall detector (the Localizer) to identify all potential stone candidates and then employs a high-precision segmentation model (the Analyst) to verify each proposal. This coarse-to-fine approach significantly improves upon baseline performance, particularly by increasing recall while simultaneously boosting precision.

### üåü Key Features

- **Two-Stage Expert Framework:** A novel Localizer-Analyst architecture that reduces false positives without compromising sensitivity.
- **State-of-the-Art Models:** Implements **YOLOv10l** for rapid and sensitive object localization and **SegFormer (MiT-B3)** for precise, pixel-level analysis.
- **Superior Performance:** Outperforms the baseline mAP@0.5 by over **7.4%**, with a significant **8.3%** relative improvement in recall.
- **Complete Pipeline:** The included Jupyter Notebook provides the full code for data preparation, model training, and evaluation.
- **Reproducible Research:** The repository is structured to allow for easy replication of the experimental results.

### üèóÔ∏è Architecture: The Localizer-Analyst Framework

The proposed architecture decomposes the detection task into two sequential stages, handled by specialized "expert" models.

1.  **The Localizer (YOLOv10l):** Performs a rapid scan of the input image to generate a set of candidate Regions of Interest (RoIs) with high recall.
2.  **The Analyst (SegFormer):** Performs a detailed, pixel-level examination of each RoI, producing a segmentation heatmap to confirm the presence of a stone.
3.  **The Fusion Manager:** Integrates the outputs from both stages, calculating a refined confidence score that effectively validates or rejects the initial proposals.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project environment.

**Prerequisites:**
- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook

- Download the [Kidney Stone Images dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/safurahajiheidari/kidney-stone-images).
- Unzip the dataset and place it in the project directory. The notebook assumes the dataset is located at `/content/drive/MyDrive/kidney-dataset`, so you may need to adjust the paths in `SegFormer_Kidney_Stone_Detection.ipynb` to match your local directory structure (e.g., `kidney-dataset/`).

---

### üöÄ Usage

The primary code is contained within the `SegFormer_Kidney_Stone_Detection.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook.

- **Running in Google Colab (Recommended):**
  1. Upload the `SegFormer_Kidney_Stone_Detection.ipynb` notebook and the `kidney-dataset` folder to your Google Drive.
  2. Update the `PROJECT_ROOT` and `DATASET_PATH` variables in the first cell to point to the correct locations in your Drive.
  3. Run the cells sequentially to execute the data preparation, model training, and evaluation pipeline.

- **Running Locally:**
  1. Ensure all dependencies are installed and the dataset is in the correct location.
  2. Launch Jupyter Notebook: `jupyter notebook`
  3. Open `Success.ipynb` and execute the cells.
